The Debian Package dput-dav
----------------------------

The "webdav" dput plugin was written specifically with Artifactory in
mind. It tries to be compatible to the http plugin, and offers the
following new features:

 * Login credentials can include the password.
 * Incoming can be a full URL, also containing dynamic metadata.
 * HTTPS support is provided by simply using a "https://..." URL.
 * Extended features like mapping distributions to repository names.
